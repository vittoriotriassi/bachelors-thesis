# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the Bachelor's thesis that I defended at University of Naples "Parthenope".

It is titled **Implementation of an Android app for the management of university counter lines** and is written in italian. You can have a look at the pdf document generated using LaTeX (see [TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf](https://github.com/vittoriotriassi/bachelors-thesis/blob/master/TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf)).

## Abstract

The following thesis is focused on the development of a prototype that allows the management of queues. More specifically, queues that generate near university front offices. Usually, these front offices are the didactic and students secretary of the University. The aim is to create a platform that allows students to digitally reserve a place in the queue they need. At the same time, we want to offer an application that allows front office operators to manage the whole system.

## Implementation

Here you can find the source code needed to make the App's prototype work. It is already in the document's appendix though. Then, I'll give some more details.
