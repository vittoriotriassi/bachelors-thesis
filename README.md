# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the Bachelor's thesis that I defended at University of Naples "Parthenope".

The thesis is titled **Implementation of an Android app for the management of university counter lines** and is written in italian. You can have a look at the pdf document generated using LaTeX (see [TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf](https://github.com/vittoriotriassi/bachelors-thesis/blob/master/TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf)). 

## Implementation

Here you can find the source code needed to make the App's prototype work. It is already in the document's appendix though. Then, I'll give some more details.
