# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the Bachelor's thesis that I defended at University of Naples "Parthenope".

The thesis is titled <b>Implementation of an Android app for the management of university counter lines</b> and is written in italian. You can have a look at the pdf document generated using LaTeX (see [TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf](https://github.com/vittoriotriassi/bachelors-thesis/blob/master/TRIASSI_Tesi.pdf)). Then, I will upload the source code needed to make the App's prototype work giving some more details. It is already in the document's appendix though.
